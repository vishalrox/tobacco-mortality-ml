# Tobacco Use and Mortality Prediction (2004–2015)

This project uses Machine Learning to analyze the relationship between tobacco use and mortality rates in England. The goal is to predict high mortality risk based on smoking behavior, healthcare burden, and socioeconomic factors.

## 🔍 Project Steps
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Selection & Training
5. Model Evaluation & Tuning
6. Model Interpretation (Feature Importance + SHAP)
7. Deployment (FastAPI + Streamlit)
8. Monitoring Strategy

## 🤖 Best Model
Random Forest Classifier

## 📊 Key Findings
- Smoking prevalence and tobacco affordability strongly impact mortality risk.
- Higher tobacco prices are associated with lower mortality.
- Socioeconomic conditions influence public health outcomes.

## 🚀 Deployment
### Run Streamlit App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
